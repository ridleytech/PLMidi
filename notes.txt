//to do 3/15/22

• Update display type for accidentals above keyboard 

//done 3/1/22

• Increase width for speed and pitch sliders
• Make add midi file button bigger
• Add the navigation buttons for the video and website
• Make drag and drop indicator full screen

//to do 2/12/22

• Maybe a mild sustain to smooth out the transition between chords.
• Add orientation video explain how to use the player

//done 2/12/22

• Rename the “pitch” knob to “Transpose.”
• Make the “Browse” button larger, and rename it to “Add MIDI File.”
• I would suggest adjusting the speed button to at least “turtle” speed. The
lowest I could adjust it was 58% which was not much different than the
100%.
• The file loader allows loading of non-midi files. Doesn’t do anything with
them which is correct, but it should filter them out.
• Display left hand and right hand colors.
• Have the loop function reset when it’s turned off.
• Clicking on the speed dial stops playback. The UI does not indicate that
this is an intended result.
• The centered green tab showing the chords is great. However Could the
spacing between the notes and symbols be increased? It looks
mashed together at times.
• If one stops the playback to check on the chords, the last chord is cleared
• Note display doesn’t show single tones, and is a bit slow to response
• The bar with the key, tempo etc I wouldn’t mind being larger.
• key names overlay each other on minor seconds where lower note is a
black key
• Show Yellow color as play head cursor moves.
• The circle adjustments for speed and pitch are hard to use. A left/right bar
or drop down may be a bit easier and clearer.
• When connected to the keyboard, note sustain dies very quickly
• Add the option to drag and drop files in instead of having to search.


updates for later

• Selection of different voices whether mellow or crisp for the piano sound
• Have a database that atomically saves all uploaded MIDI file.
